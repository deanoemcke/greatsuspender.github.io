The Great Suspender is not-so-great now, as it has been [sold to some unknown entity](https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/issues/1175) that – after months of silence – [released a new version with malicious code](https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/issues/1263).
The extension was subsequently **removed from Chrome Web Store**.
